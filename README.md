# SeniorProject
This is the version control for my senior project

I have done lots of work before the first update.
The first update is going to be the first version of test bed of Indoor Localization Using Mobile Phone, which use mysql, a non-realtime database, as the database part. This will lead to a more-then-3-seconds delay which should be able to fixed by using firebase, a realtime database system. 
The problem is: I need to restart the whole project since the firebase database will need the cell phone to directly communicate with, rather than the cell phone send data to server, server send data to firebase system. This will lead to almost 60 percent work worth nothing.
------------------------------------Let start the first version of the complete project.
